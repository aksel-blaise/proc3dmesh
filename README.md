# Processing Matters: 3D Mesh Morphology

This systematic study demonstrates the variable impacts that processing decisions have upon 3D meshes.

This study leverages a batch protocol developed in Geomagic Control X as a means of systematically evaluating processed meshes, with the goal of demonstrating the variability in mesh morphology introduced during the processing workflow.
