# Processing Matters: 3D Mesh Morphology

Substantive advancements have been made toward automating the application of landmarks and semilandmarks. These approaches can aid in expediting the landmarking process, while simultaneously reducing landmarking errors and investigator bias. This study enlists a template-based approach to quantify deviations in mesh processing outputs using a Pontchartrain dart point from the collections of the National Forests and Grasslands in Texas, which was scanned and processed at multiple resolutions using a NextEngine laser scanner. Following data collection and output, meshes were processed using a standard processing workflow. A batch processing protocol was developed using _Geomagic Design X_ and _Geomagic Control X_ to facilitate exploratory comparisons of the processed meshes, which indicated that the greatest changes to the meshes occurred along the lateral margins of the dart point. Results of the geometric morphometric study evince implications for processed meshes curated in digital repositories, making it clear that should investigators endeavour to incorporate curated meshes that they should begin with the unprocessed data, enlist uniform processing protocols across the sample, and comprehend the many vagaries of 3D data collection and processing across different modalities.

This study systematically evaluates 3D meshes collected with a NextEngine HD scanner, and processed (remeshed) at different resolutions, with the goal of demonstrating where variation occurs in the mesh morphology. The protocol includes a comparison of 3D meshes, a series of 2D comparisons of cross-sections, and deviations for comparison points placed at mathematically-defined locations (i.e., horizontal/vertical tangents, points of highest curvature, etc.).

The analysis identified those areas where the meshes differ. Those results indicate that 3D scan data collected and processed using identical protocols (best case scenario) differ most in high-curvature areas. The high-curvature areas of projectile points (lateral edges) represent some of the most likely locations for landmark and semilandmark placement, given their contribution to the description of the general shape of the point in plan view.
