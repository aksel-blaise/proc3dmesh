# Processing Matters: 3D Mesh Morphology

This systematic study demonstrates the variable impacts that processing decisions have upon 3D meshes.

The study leverages a batch protocol developed using Geomagic Design X and Control X to systematically evaluate processed meshes, with the goal of demonstrating the variation in mesh morphology introduced during the processing workflow.

Results for the comparison of shapes using ![HDPRO-H1-ReGen1](./files/HDPRO-H1-ReGen1.pdf) demonstrates a general overview for the preliminary comparison of laser scan data. In addition to those scans processed in the scanner-specific software, additional processing protocols were enlisted using the Rvcg package in R.

MicroCT scan data were collected with a Bruker SkyScan, and laser scan data were collected using a NextEngineHD. All raw and processed data are open access, and will be made available for download at the conclusion of the analysis.
