# Processing Matters: 3D Mesh Morphology

This systematic study demonstrates the variable impacts that processing decisions have upon 3D meshes.

The study leverages a batch protocol developed using Geomagic Control X as a means of systematically evaluating processed meshes, with the goal of demonstrating the variation in mesh morphology that is introduced during the processing workflow.

Results for comparison of shapes using ![HDPRO-H1-ReGen1](./files/HDPRO-H1-ReGen1.pdf) demonstrates a general overview of a preliminary run of the comparison of laser scan data for a single scan. In addition to those scans processed in the scanner-specific software, further processing protocols were explored using the Rvcg package in R.

MicroCT scan data were collected using a Bruker SkyScan, and laser scan data were collected with a NextEngineHD. All raw and processed data for this project are open access, and will be made available for download at the conclusion of this project.
